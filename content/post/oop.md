I started learning programming while pursuing my interest in biotechnology. I noticed that a number of biological problems could be solved using informatics 

When I started learning programming, my goal was to solve a problem at any given point in time. 

The imperative paradigm, also known as the procedural paradigm - defines the programming process to be the development of a sequence of commands that, when followed, manipulate data to produce the desired result. Thus the imperative paradigm tells us to approach the programming process by finding an algorithm to solve the problem at hand and then expressing that algorithm as a sequence of commands.

“building block” approach to software development - self- contained units



Key Terms: 

1. Function

function refers to a program unit similar to a procedure except that a value is transferred back to the calling pro- gram unit as “the value of the function.” That is, as a consequence of executing the function, a value will be computed and sent back to the calling program unit. This value can then be stored in a variable for later reference or used immediately in a computation

2. Object

a software system is viewed as a collection of units, called objects, each of which is capable of performing the actions that are imme- diately related to itself as well as requesting actions of other objects. Together, these objects interact to solve the problem at hand.

object can consist of data (such as a list of names) together with a collection of methods for performing activities (such as inserting new names in the list).


3. Class (reusuable chunk which has functions/methods and variables/attributes) <imperative/oop>
class - cookie cutter template
object - actual cookie obtained by using class/cutter - share properties of class

Methods/Behaviours


These features must be described by statements in the written program. This description of the object’s properties is called a class. Once a class has been constructed, it can be applied anytime an object with those characteristics is needed. Thus, several objects can be based on (that is, built from) the same class

Just like identical twins, these objects would be distinct entities but would have the same characteristics because they are constructed from the same template (the same class). (An object that is based on a particular class is said to be an instance of that class.)

class describes the common characteristics of a collection of objects in much the same way as the concept of the primitive data type integer encompasses the common characteristics of such numbers as 1, 5, and 82



The objective of OOP is to make logical bundles or groups of functions for re-using them for repetative tasks later.
