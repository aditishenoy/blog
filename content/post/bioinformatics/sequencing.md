template preparation, sequencing and imaging, genome alignment and assembly approaches

range of applications for NGS technologies

Guidelines for platform selection

Automatic Sanger Sequencing - 

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has the uique capability to produce a high number of read oer run (large volume of data for cheap)


1. Preparing templates for NGS reactions
* clonally amplified templates originating from single DNA molecules
* single DNA- molecule templates







There are some examples:
1. Roche/454
2. Illumina/Solexa
4 colour/2 colour/single colour channel
3. Life/APG
4. Helicos BioSciences
5. Polonator instrument 
6. Pacific Biosciences
7. Nanopore sequencing (Branton and colleagues)
