Installing Nvidia Drivers and Cuda on a Linux machine can be a tricky affair. Though it is possible to install both the nvidia-driver and the nvidia-cuda-toolkit using a package manager, it could result in incompatibile versions and could potentially break the graphics or operating system. In this post I have described how I have kept the driver and toolkit separate using singularity containers to check for conflicting versions and prevent potential mishaps. 

Brief notes on terminology: 

* [*CUDA*](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#introduction) - parallel computing platform and programming model to communicate with NVIDIA GPUs
* [*Nvidia Driver*](https://www.geforce.com/drivers) - software that allows the NVIDIA GPU to communicate with the operating system 
* [*Singularity Container*](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/build_a_container.html) - a file/image running an operating system on top of the host system's operating system. The software environment of the container is determined by the contents of the singularity image and what is run within the container will not affect the host operating system. 

These were my system specifications:

```bash 
ashenoy@hostname~$ uname -m && cat /etc/*release
x86_64
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
```

I first started with searching for and installing Nvidia-driver outside container since root priviledges are needed for this. 

```bash
#Search for versions of drivers applicable for current operating system
ashenoy@hostname:~$ apt search nvidia-driver
Sorting... Done
Full Text Search... Done
nvidia-driver-390/focal,focal 390.132-0ubuntu2 amd64
  NVIDIA driver metapackage

nvidia-driver-435/focal,focal 435.21-0ubuntu7 amd64
  NVIDIA driver metapackage

nvidia-driver-440/focal 440.82+really.440.64-0ubuntu6 amd64
  NVIDIA driver metapackage
  
# Or try the following command
ashenoy@hostname:~$ ubuntu-drivers list
nvidia-driver-390, (kernel modules provided by linux-modules-nvidia-390-generic-hwe-20.04)
nvidia-driver-435, (kernel modules provided by linux-modules-nvidia-435-generic-hwe-20.04)
nvidia-driver-440, (kernel modules provided by linux-modules-nvidia-440-generic-hwe-20.04)
```

Since I already had a driver installed and I needed to change the version, I did the following: 

```bash 
#Remove old version of driver
ashenoy@hostname:~$ sudo apt remove <NVIDIA-DRIVER-VERSION-TO-REMOVE>
#Install nvidia-modprobe and graphics-drivers/ppa
ashenoy@hostname:~$ sudo apt install nvidia-modprobe
ashenoy@hostname:~$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
# Update and install the driver version you need
ashenoy@hostname:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
ashenoy@hostname:~$ sudo apt-get install <NVIDIA-DRIVER-VERSION-NEEDED>
#To check if driver version has been updated
ashenoy@hostname:~$ nvidia-smi
Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch
ashenoy@hostname:~$ sudo reboot
```
After the reboot, the error "Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch" did not persist and the output of nvidia-smi was as below. 


```bash
ashenoy@hostname:~$ nvidia-smi

```
Following this I created singularity container as described [here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/gpu.html)

```bash
ashenoy@hostname~$ singularity pull docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
ashenoy@hostname~$ singularity run --nv tensorflow_latest-gpu.sif
Singularity> cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS \n \l
#(Note how the operating system inside this container was 18.04 while the host operating system shown at the beginning of this article was 20.4)
```
and followed the instructions for installing nvidia-cuda-toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). I selected Linux -> x86_64 -> Ubuntu -> deb(local)

```bash
Singularity> wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu1804.pin
Singularity> mv cuda-ubuntu1804.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
Singularity> wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu1804-10-2-local-10.2.89-440.33.01_1.0-1_amd64.deb
Singularity> dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1804-10-2-local-10.2.89-440.33.01_1.0-1_amd64.deb
Singularity> apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-10-2-local-10.2.89-440.33.01/7fa2af80.pub
Singularity> apt-get update
Singularity>apt-get -y install cuda

#Check the nvidia-cuda-toolkit version 
Singularity> nvcc -V
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver

Singularity> exit
ashenoy@hostname~$ sudo reboot
```
At this point, I was getting an output for nvidia-smi and nvcc -V (with compatible versions) inside the singularity container. Using the following commands, tensorflow was able to find and identify the number of GPUs available in the system. 

```bash

## But pytorch wasn't finding the gpu

>>> import torch

>>> print (device)
cpu
>>> print (torch.cuda.is_available())
False
>>> print(torch.version.cuda)
10.2
```

So I removed pytorch  1.5.0 and installed an older version 1.0.0 instead. 

```
Singularity> pip3 install torch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1

Singularity> python

>>> import torch
>>> print (torch.cuda.is_available())
True
```

And everything was right with the world again...
