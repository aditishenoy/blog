<!--I am a healthcare developer passionate about data science, medical technology and precision medicine. I am driven towards using artificial intelligence and adapting latest technologies to personalize value-based healthcare and facilitate global accessibility of quality care.-->

I am a PhD researcher in Protein Bioinformatics and Deep Learning at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm. I am currently working on using deep learning techniques to study sub-cellular localization in proteins i.e. predicting the signal in protein sequences to determine which area in the cell the protein will migrate to. 

I am a graduate with a Masters in Science (M.Sc.) in Health Informatics from Karolinska Institutet, a renowned and leading medical university in Europe. I have a background in Biotechnology Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, India. My interdisciplinary background gives me broad insights in the fields of genomics, proteomics, healthcare as well as information technology and data science.

<!--Being a highly tenacious problem solver, not knowing what secrets large datasets hold and exploring it to find patterns, makes me feel like a detective in a lab coat.--> 

<!--Having a strong growth-oriented mindset and a compelling urge to create an impact to improve global health, I am in pursuit of a career which can help me combine my passions for programming and biology. I am:
I have worked with multiple machine learning and deep learning projects for healthcare and bioinformatics applications. Additionally, I have worked with projects involving e-health modelling, requirements engineering, prototyping, usability testing and technology evaluation.

> ✨ Always interested in having discussions about precision medicine ⚕️, data privacy 🔏, bioinformatics 🧬, yoga 🧘, philosophy or global health reform 🌏

> ✨ Easily impressed with beautiful visualisations of data 📊 & meticulous documentation of code 👩‍💻 

> ✨ Often found in my natural habit with my laptop, headphones & a cup of tea! ☕️ -->
